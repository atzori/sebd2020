 **DEADLINE EXTENSION: March 15th, 2019**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with computing technologies that allow machines to see, hear, talk, think, learn, and solve problems. The huge potential of applying AI for problem solving represents an exciting future that business objectives can be achieved much more effectively. In addition, business-business, business-customer, and customer-customer may be interconnected in a revolutionary way to stimulate tremendous amount of interesting activities. A core of AI is Knowledge Engineering that addresses the acquisition, understanding, description, storage, integration, processing, control, and use of knowledge, among others.

The 2nd IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (IEEE AIKE 2019) is an international forum for academia and industries to exchange visions and ideas in the state of the art and practice of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering, as well as to identify the emerging topics and define the future of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering.

More details will follow in a separated post. Please checkout the conference website.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Authors are invited to submit an 8-page (regular), 4-page (short), or 2-page (poster and demo) manuscript in double-column IEEE format. Manuscripts must be written in English.
All paper submissions will be carefully reviewed by at least three experts, and reviews will be returned to the author(s) with comments to ensure the high quality of the accepted papers. The authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference. Please only submit original material where copyright of all parts is owned by the authors declared and which is not currently under review elsewhere.

The conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer  Society Press. Distinguished quality papers presented at the conference will be selected for the best paper/poster awards and for publication in internationally renowned journals.
Selected papers from the previous edition of IEEE AIKE have been invited for publication at Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS Journal, Elsevier) and International Journal of Semantic Computing (IJSC Journal, World Scientific).

LOCATION
The 2019 IEEE AIKE conference will be located in Cagliari, Italy, in the historical area of Marina by the city harbor.
Cagliari is on the southern coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean famous for its white-sand beaches and clean waters. Cagliari international airport is connected with about 70 direct flights (including many low-cost flights) to Italy and Europe. The climate is Mediterranean, with mild winters and many sunny days. The main beach Poetto is only 10 minutes from the city center, reachable by urban buses. https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/places/south/cagliari
