Dr. C.V. Ramamoorthy (1926-2016) was a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He was a strong promoter of the field of Knowledge Engineering and the founding Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (IEEE TKDE). He was also a truly outstanding scholar and a superb teacher and mentor for all his students and numerous other colleagues. Professor Ramamoorthy's research accomplishments span several important areas of Computer Science and Engineering, including synthesis of parallel programs, optimal organization and scheduling of parallel programs, recovery and roll-back techniques for enhancing the dependability of distributed systems, automated simulation and testing of safety-critical systems, and other innovative research areas. His research contributions have had significant positive impacts on humanity by enhancing the dependability of safety-critical distributed real-time embedded systems. Over the years, Professor Ramamoorthy published numerous papers in prestigious journals and conferences and also wrote several books based on his research. He also obtained patents in computer architecture, software engineering, computer testing and diagnosis, and databases.

Dr. Ramamoorthy received six earned degrees, including an undergraduate degree in physics and also an undergraduate degree in textile technology, two graduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering and later two graduate degrees from Harvard in Applied Mathematics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, including his Ph.D. Degree in 1964. He then joined the University of Texas, Austin, as a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He also served as the Chair of the UT Austin Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and then in 1972 he joined UC Berkeley as a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  During his long career, he also served on many advisory committees, including those of the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy; Los Alamos Labs; Lockheed Research; Hitachi; NEC; Song; and IBM. He also significantly contributed to the computer science and engineering communities by serving as the Education Chair of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies and starting the Society for Design and Process Science where he served a Board Chairman until his passing.

Professor Ramamoorthy was also an outstanding educator whose work has contributed significantly to several aspects of engineering, computer science, and software engineering. He supervised 73 Ph.D. students and he greatly mentored each of his students. Together with Raymond T. Yeh, he is given credit for the early establishment of the discipline of software engineering, the largest of all the engineering disciplines. He was an important figure in the development of computing technology, and was always looking forward to the future. He had a large following worldwide with whom he actively collaborated until the last few months of his life.

The IEEE Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (IEEE AIKE) conference presents the C.V. Ramamoorthy Award annually to an educator/researcher based on the following criteria: 
  1. Education in computer science and engineering; 
  2. Research in Artificial Intelligence and/or Knowledge Engineering; 
  3. Services to computer science and engineering communities; 
  4. Mentoring students and colleagues; 
  5. Enhancing humanity. 

The award consists of a bronze medal, a certificate, and an honorarium of **USD$2,000**.
