title: International Workshop on Technology Enhanced Learning and Assessment (TELA) at IEEE AIKE 2019
---


## Workshop Aim
Our workshop aims at gathering researchers, experts and practitioners who are
modeling, designing, prototyping, implementing and evaluating Technology
Enhanced Learning and Assessment (TELA) solutions in education and higher
education. Research papers, system descriptions, demonstrations and tutorials
are all highly welcomed proposals. Special appreciation and attention are
dedicated to proposals that emphasize the crucial role of AI and knowledge
engineering in designing and building TELA systems and tools.

## Call for Papers and Participation

We welcome the submission of original works in form of *(1) short papers*  [2 to 4 pages],
with possible *virtual* presentation, *(2) tutorials and demos* and *(3) work groups* that
revolve around (but not limited to) the following topics:
 
 - TELA Modeling and Knowledge Representation (e.g. learner profiles and e-Portfolios representation, learning and assessment data interoperability and integration with LMS)
 - Semantic Web and Ontologies for E-Learning and E-Assessment
 - Theories of Learning and Assessment with Technology
 - Design and Development of Digital Learning and Assessment Environments
 - Learning and Assessment Analytics
 - Artificial Intelligence in Assessment Processes
 - Game-based Learning and Assessment
 - Personalization and Adaptive Learning and Assessment
 - TELA strategies, scenarios, sharable experiences and success stories
 - TELA with Serious Games, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
 - TELA tools, applications, system descriptions, tutorials and demos
