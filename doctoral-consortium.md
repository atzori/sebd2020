title: Doctoral Consortium and Young Researchers Travel Awards

Young researchers and Ph.D. students are invited to apply for admission to the doctoral consortium to be held at the IEEE AIKE Conference, Cagliari, Italy, June 3-5, 2019.

The doctoral consortium provides an opportunity for Ph.D. students and other young researchers to discuss their research interests and career objectives with established researchers in AI and Knowledge Engineering, while networking with other participants. The doctoral consortium also provides a fellowship to support up to 15 young researchers to attend AIKE and spend 1 month visiting and collaborating with one of the following Italian research institutions:

 - DMI, Università di Cagliari
 - DIAG, Sapienza Università di Roma
 - DII, Università di Brescia
 - ICAR, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (Rende)
 - DIBRIS, Università di Genova
 - DI, Libera Università di Bolzano
 - DIA, Università Roma Tre


The awards will be:

 - $2500+ for European young researchers (researchers from Italy are not eligible)
 - $3350+ for non-European young researchers

Young researchers that qualify for the grants will be provided 50% of the award at IEEE AIKE 2019 conference, and 50% at the end of the research period.
These awards may be incremented depending on agreements to avoid double taxation ([it](http://www.finanze.gov.it/opencms/it/fiscalita-comunitaria-e-internazionale/convenzioni-e-accordi/convenzioni-per-evitare-le-doppie-imposizioni/index.html), [en](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.finanze.gov.it%2Fopencms%2Fit%2Ffiscalita-comunitaria-e-internazionale%2Fconvenzioni-e-accordi%2Fconvenzioni-per-evitare-le-doppie-imposizioni%2Findex.html)).
